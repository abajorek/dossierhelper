# Dossier Helper - New Features Summary

## üéâ Major Updates

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Google Drive Integration (Multi-Drive Support)

Dossier Helper now supports scanning and processing files from **multiple Google Drive accounts** in addition to local file systems!

#### Key Features:
- **Multi-Drive Support**: Connect 2+ Google Drive accounts simultaneously
- **Selective Scanning**: Scan entire drives or specific folders
- **OAuth Authentication**: Secure, token-based authentication with automatic refresh
- **Real-Time Progress**: See download progress for each file (bytes downloaded/total)
- **Seamless Integration**: Works alongside local file scanning in a single workflow

#### How It Works:
1. Configure Google Drive accounts in `example_config.yaml`
2. Run Dossier Helper - it will prompt for authentication (first time only)
3. Both local files AND Google Drive files are scanned in the same pass
4. Google Drive files are temporarily downloaded, processed, and classified
5. Results include files from all sources in a unified report

#### Configuration Example:
```yaml
google_drives:
  - name: "personal"
    enabled: true
    folder_id: null  # Scan entire drive
    client_secrets_file: "~/.dossierhelper/personal_credentials.json"
  
  - name: "work"
    enabled: true
    folder_id: "1aB2cD3eF4gH5iJ..."  # Scan specific folder
    client_secrets_file: "~/.dossierhelper/work_credentials.json"
```

### üìä Individual File Progress Meter (0-100%)

Each file now shows **real-time processing progress** with detailed step-by-step updates!

#### What You See:

- **Step Labels**: Clear indication of what's happening (e.g., "Downloading", "Extracting text", "Classifying")
- **Step Icons**: Emoji indicators for each processing stage
- **Download Progress**: For Google Drive files, see exact byte counts

#### Processing Steps:
1. üìÇ **Loading file** (0-30%)
   - For local files: Quick file access
   - For Google Drive: Download with byte-by-byte progress
2. üìã **Reading metadata** (30-45%) - Extract file properties
3. üìÑ **Extracting text** (45-70%) - Parse document contents
4. üîç **Classifying document** (70-85%) - Pattern matching and categorization
5. ‚è±Ô∏è **Estimating effort** (85-90%) - Calculate time metrics
6. üè∑Ô∏è **Applying Finder tags** (90-100%) - macOS tag application (local files only)
7. üéâ **Complete!** (100%)

#### Visual Example:

- **Enhanced Pipeline**: Updated `pipeline.py` with unified local + cloud file processing
- **Real Progress Tracking**: Replaced simulated progress with actual processing metrics

### Configuration
- **Extended Config Schema**: New `GoogleDriveConfig` class
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing configs work without changes
- **Flexible Credentials**: Multiple ways to specify OAuth credentials

## üéØ Use Cases

### Academic Dossier Building
- Scan local Documents and Desktop folders
- **NEW**: Also scan Google Drive folders for:
  - Shared collaborative research documents
  - Teaching materials stored in cloud
  - Service documents from committees
- Get a comprehensive view of all academic work

### Multi-Account Workflows
- Personal Google Drive for individual research
- University Google Drive for official documents
- Collaborative Google Drive for team projects
- All processed in a single run!

### Selective Scanning
- Scan entire drives for comprehensive coverage
- Or specify folder IDs for targeted scanning
- Mix local folders and cloud folders as needed

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Read-Only Access**: Only reads files, never modifies or deletes
- **Secure Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with token storage
- **Local Processing**: Files are processed locally on your machine
- **Revocable**: Easy to revoke access at any time
- **No Data Sharing**: Your files stay between you and Google

## üéÆ Strong Bad Commentary Mode

All the entertaining RedLetterMedia and Homestar Runner references are still there:
- "How embarrassing!" for unclassified files
- "OH MY GAAAWD!" for large files
- "JORB WELL DONE!" when complete
- "The Cheat is grounded!" for various occasions
- And much more!

Now with cloud-specific taunts:
- "Oh, seriously? Downloading from the cloud?"
- "Very cool, very cool cloud storage!"
- "The system is down! Wait, no, it's just downloading..."

## üöÄ Performance Notes

### Google Drive Scanning
- **First run**: May take time depending on drive size
- **Recommendation**: Use `folder_id` to scan specific folders
- **Download overhead**: Cloud files need temporary local download
- **Efficient**: Files are only downloaded during processing, not permanently stored

### Progress Tracking
- **Real-time updates**: No more fake progress animations
- **Accurate ETAs**: Based on actual processing speed
- **Responsive UI**: Progress updates every step of the way
- **No blocking**: Multi-threaded to keep UI responsive

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Finder Tags**: Only applied to local files (not Google Drive files)
2. **Download Required**: Google Drive files must be downloaded temporarily
3. **OAuth Setup**: Requires Google Cloud Console setup (one-time)
4. **Rate Limits**: Google Drive API has usage quotas (rarely an issue)

## üéì Credits

Built with:
- **Google Drive API**: For cloud file access
- **Rich**: For beautiful console output  
- **tkinter**: For the GUI
- **Strong Bad**: For spiritual guidance
- **RedLetterMedia**: For quality burns
- **The Cheat**: For not being involved

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Install Google Drive support**: `pip install -e ".[gdrive]"`
2. **Set up OAuth credentials**: Follow `docs/GOOGLE_DRIVE_SETUP.md`
3. **Configure your drives**: Edit `example_config.yaml`
4. **Run Dossier Helper**: `python run_dossierhelper.py`
5. **Watch the progress bars**: See each file get processed step by step!
6. **Enjoy organized academic files**: Teaching (Green), Scholarship (Blue), Service (Yellow)
